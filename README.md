# Smart-eBike-Simulator
This is repository for our team's Senior Design Project.

# Description
Due to the COVID-19 situation, as of May 2nd, 2020 our Senior Design Project (which can be found at https://github.com/JAePortfolio/Smart-eBike)
has been paused due to further notice, since we do not have access to any of our materials, labs or equipment.
With that said, **this project will temporarily replace it.** It is a C++ GUI program that will simulate our Smart eBike Design.
